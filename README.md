# spotify-playlist-dna
A React app that, using the Spotify API, obtains the genres of the tracks in any public Spotify playlist.

Genres of the tracks are obtained, and then a graph is created showcasing the genre distribution of all the tracks in the playlist.

So far, the application can support playlists of up to 60 songs.

To run, clone the repo, then go to command shell in file directory.
In command shell, type "npm install" to install all the dependencies.
Then type "npm start" to run the app.
